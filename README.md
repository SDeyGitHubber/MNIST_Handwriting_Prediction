## MNIST_Handwriting_Prediction
This is a handwriting prediction model, trained on the MNIST Dataset, using Multi Layer Neural Network, that can predict numbers from 0-9, based on individual handwritings
### Some features of the project
* We have trained a model on the MNIST Dataset, using Callback functions.
* The project has been implemented in Google Colab, with relevant files stored in Google Drive
* It includes visualisations, using graphs on how the train and validation accuracy varied after using callbacks
* It has acquired an accracy of 97.80% on the test data, when the CallBack functions were included in training the model and 98.07%, without it
* It also includes sample test datasets to demonstrate its accuracy
